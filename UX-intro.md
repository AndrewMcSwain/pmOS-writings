this is my canvas, i post things on UX and brandinf here. 

Draft 2.25

PostmarketOS
or pmOS for short

Tools are one of the oldest and most distinctive human features

Branding:
Family Love and tool making are ancient, primordial, integral to humanity. 
A >-(commonality)<- B
Publicity abd branding should associate  these, emphasize this commonality in clever ways.

"You should use this tech, learn it, become more human (revive your deep human roots)(which have been somewhat lost in post-industrial world)"

## brand associations
### primary association
love your family
be a toolmaker

### lateral association
Exercise is important- dont be sedentary
complex and amazing tool making an tool use is important for everyone too. --- dont be mentally sedentary.


# What is the focus of our research

Most of the foundational work for this operating system is anthropological. What is anthropolgy? The study of man. We are focusing on the study of man , his tools, and his environment. 

for us, thhis research is applied practically to:
*an exploration into the heart of what makes linux appealing*

Some of the ways this research will be conducted:

## Anthropological:
interviews and oral histories 
historical analysis
theoretical (psychoanalysis of user groups)

## Marketing

The tasks for marketing include: 

-**COLLECTION** scraping, parsing, and profiling content from user-curated content aggregators.
-**ANALYSIS** find out who our potential users/non-users are. What do they like?  what do they talk about, etc.?
-**DISPLAY** developing novel ways to visualize our (subjective) findings. 
--VR Displays and motion capture of hand gestures to sift through 3 dimensional layers of media, organized spatially according to relations.


Linux is a powerful tool. As are smart phones. When you combine the two, you have yourself and incredible tool. One of the inital focal points of our anthropological research-- what we are seeking to find out first-- is about this relationship, between tool (linux and computing) and human
-how it develops
-how it grows
-why it wanes
-interactions between users (communities)
-inter-community relationships
-relations between developers and users and between developers and decision-makers and between users and decision-makers (product owners).

We are trying to find out what motivates people to become so deeply involved with linux devlopment and use. It`s not easy being a hacker/nerd/computer guru! What motivates people to get to this level? What about the rest of us? I'm not a power user, but most people think that I'm a wizard because I know how to rip audio from a youtube playlist. This has contained within it an element of gamification. 

The natural outgrowth from this is desigining layers of interaction between the total newbie and the uber-hacker. Our job is to design interfaces that appeal to a sense of wonder, discovery, and problem-reward behavior. Necessarily, we need not only interesting and interconnected layers of interfaces, but also a mythos, a story, a set of symbols, that defines our common journey as humans.
<link to common_journey.md>>

And that is exciting.

So, rather than thinking of progress in terms of moving foward. Think of the user path of user experience, his curve, as a deepening, and we must design interfaces, with themes and functionalities, that consider the incredibly vast ocean of discovery that awaits us.


We have more content related to user-paths. This is a key element to the design of an OS that tries to [break the false-dichotomy of expert and layman] that has plagued the computing world since the mid-to-late nineties. <<insert content links here>


goals: 
1.understand possible relations between users, the tool, their environment, and their needs.
2.understand how the relation between these elememts changes over time, many times as a result of tool use (how fluency in use transforms use, relation, and need)
3. how these user groups and their flow converge. What is their conversation within and between groups and what is the conversation between users and the non-using public,

To do:
1. make a diagram explaining a few possible paths of user 'deepening' of use. --=> Through an understanding these rabbit holes, and recognizing the importance of discovery in this product, we can prepare and help our users with these phases (define them) and consider in the design architecture of the system.
2. Explain in detail the relation between this community and the car collector and car modification comminities. there are also a lot of key differences.

What do users want
interface between groups of users
  Ex: tech forums, tutorials, meetings, lessons
  New, more fun or interactive activities between levels of users
  Important: dont construct expertise as a hierarchy, see it as a deepening. Why? Community hierarchy centered on USE of tool, rather than it being an end-in-itself. This rids us of toxic elitism.

the people being targeted or who we would would like to attract (or are disposed to being attracted), have, within the group, a diversity of subtle differences in identity and necessity that can be expressed in two ways: functionality and design. 




Visual and brand design is the narrative that connects the tool with the user, with it's use, and the community of collective meaning that user and his tool use is embedded in.
User -problemXXXXX(|barrier|]- Necessity
User -tool->problem =solution>=> Fulfilment
\________using tools__________/
  \_____to solve problems____/
     \fulfiling necessities/
        is fulfilling, too.

The functionalities, or, better in our case, the *modes of participation* of a user can follow an arc. They get into pmOS for a host of reasons, and it can be a tool that expands according to their changing needs, habits of use, and their course and position along the practical learning trajectory. The arc is beginner, then to discovery and experimentation and on to specialization. With the Vertical axis (y?) being the number of possible modes and that people after manynyears of use become entrenched in a specific way if doing things.

The themes, and *especially* how they blend,  represent two things
1) layers of participation (deepening)
2) user-determined modes of use(widening)
In linux to widen you *must* deepen first. The process of widening, of customizing the tool (or customizing your use of it) according to your new necessity will deepen your knowledge and praxis of said device/tool. As one deepens and widens one's relationship with this tech, this brand, it is, whether we recognize it or not, is ALWAYS  accompanied by an aesthetic, or a narrative, that explains to us and to the world what in the fuck it is we are doing. The alegorical implications of the themes a were very carefully determined.

Deepening and widening as terminology to describe activities.

The psychology of the diehard linux user:

A) learns a technique for solving a problem
...in the process he/she...
B) learns about a lot of other things that can be used to solve other or perhaps harder problems. 
...understanding or prowess of the tool also brings pride, stimulating an emotional, ego-bound, connection with the tool.
C) After using the tech and techniquesn to solve a problem, and consequently feeling satisfied with his/herself and his/her tool, the propensity is heighten for spontaneously coming up with a lot of cool, fun, or interesting things to do with the tool. It's a natural and instinctive form of play that man does with tool due to this relation discussed in B, and is very healthy, as it also further improves his skill in using the tool.

motivations
(A)Satisfaction (of having solved a problem)
(B)Curiosity and Discovery
(C)Innovation, Creativity, Art (
these motivations reinforce each other

Interesting profiles of man's relationship with tech. 

Another similar andmore widely recognized/respectedis with old and ultra-new (concept and sports) cars.
Car culture reduced the complexity of human interaction in cities by reducing frequency of physical proximity, thereby reducing probability of physical, hence 'meaningful,' contact

Smart phones have reduced the layer of attention size that interfaces with the 'real world'

by meaningful i mean significant or personally and socially relevant, with social also agregating what many have in the past called 'material' or that which interfaces and is relevant to life-system ecology and physical limits on scale and causality.

Look at impacts of 'computing culture' with respect to...?
