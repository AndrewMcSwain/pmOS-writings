# postMarketOS 
----------------------------
This is a collection of writings about the [postmarketOS]().

We focus on the philosophy of design, branding, publicity, and marketing, as well as UX and systems research. Most of the work here is focused on perception and relationships, rather than the nuts and bolts. 


**NOTICE** 
*We are working on a promotoinal video,* 
Oriented by some preliminary work on the branding and anthropology of a few of postmarketOS's hypothetical user demographics.

*We are looking for participants in this project who possess or would like to possess applicable skills in the following areas:
--the preliminary theoretical and design work
--the plannning and execution (production)
--post-production (editing and after-effects) 
--as well as the promo's insertion strategy, or internal usage with focus groups and market radaring.*
Thanks!

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in this discussion. Feel free to ask questions if something is too vague or too poetic. I am more than happy, estatic, really, to recieve comments, criticisms, and collaborations. I urge you to participate even if you think it is not your field

The target audience for this is our ENGINEERS, **YOU**. We need your contributions, mutual comprehension is the goal here.

Below is a brief explanation of some of the areas of interest:

# Theoretical
## UX: 

The anthropology of our users and their tool systems. 

WHAT: *UX is more than just designing interfaces.* It is a study of the product's use from the user's point of view. It is an observational exercise. UX Design must take behavioral observations and transform them into actionable conclusions that can determine design decisions.

*key words: abstraction layer, gestalt, user-story, user path, information flows*

## Branding: 

The psychology of identity, community, and use

WHAT: *Branding is more than just your logo and jingle.* It is a study into the perception of your organization's activities, measuring sentiment and comparing that with other brands in the same space. Branding effort is about finding a way to tell your product's story, a way to tell your user's story and how your product is an essential element of that story. Branding is **essential**

Branding:
Family Love and tool making are ancient, primordial, integral to humanity. 
A >-(commonality)<- B
Publicity abd branding should associate  these, emphasize this commonality in clever ways.

"You should use this tech, learn it, become more human (revive your deep human roots)(which have been somewhat lost in post-industrial world)"

## brand associations
### primary association
love your family
be a toolmaker

### lateral association
Exercise is important- dont be sedentary
complex and amazing tool making an tool use is important for everyone too. --- dont be mentally sedentary.

to the success and survival of any endeavore

*Key words: positioning, theme, visual identity, relationship, narrative, mythos, coherent, authentic*

## Philosophy/Poetry

general considerations about the nature of reality which are pertinent to our activities at postmarketOS

WHAT: *Philosphy and poetry are more than mere decorative elememts.* They help guide and orient all other efforts. They contextualize approaches and establish base assumptions of logic that can bring sophistication to our efforts and help us innovate.

# Practical
## Marketing:

Marketing is all about getting to know your users, learning about their lives and how to relate to them-- to essentially give them what they want and need. 

Marketing is am exercise in rational empathy.

WHAT: *marketing is more than just commercials and selling.* marketing â‰ commercialization. It is the eyes and ears of the operations.

+What is working? 
+What isn't working? 
+Who are our users? 
+What do they want from our product? 
+What are their dreams, desires, hopes, and inspirations?
+What are they deprived of? 
+What do they have in abundance?
+What irritates them?
+What interests them?

*How can our product, besides solving their pain-point, align with the other aspects of their life?*

*key words: product-market fit, marketing plan, top-down and bottom-up market evaluation, appeals, maslov*

## Aesthetic Design: 

Aesthetic design must consider both the image and the story. It must find metaphors, as well as sensorial and conceptual associations, that are suitable for the concept. 

WHAT: *Aesthetic Design is more than just making something look pleasing and legible.* The visual identity of the brand and its products gives a sense of coherent personhood to both of the aforementiomed categories. Almost all brands have spent a considerable amount of time and effort creating allegorical references to their user-product-brand relaionship chain.

*key words: textures, mythos, allegory, reference, moodboard*

## Publicity:

how do people learn about your products and brand?

Aesthetic Design, your brand's mythos, your consumer's pain points, and your solution can be systematically expressed using the guides of Marketing 

How can market research guide branding, publcity, and design?

## User-Interface Projects: 

New pmOS-sourced functionality and engineering perspectives

WHAT: *designing user-interfaces is a lot more than 'getting the background in cornflower blue.'* This is an important aspect of the reality construct of the user. It molds his/her understanding of the content he/she is engaged with and what possibilities further are available.

User-interface design, *hackable* ui, is an area that has lots of room for movement.

contents overview: concrete ideas for the UI and how the experience of the user can unfold through direct interactions with the product.

EXAMPLES: hacking the android interfaces to improve flexibility and/or ease users into a creative and technical mentality. making it easier to hack them (as easy as html css or react). clone android interface as a starting point for a possible pmOS skin or theme. multiple themes or profiles that can be shifted between, without losing work or modifying stack, just shift abstraction layer characteristics to better suit need. this will require it's own page. this kind of stuff goes here.


## Scraps and Notes:

where everything can go, if you dont want it any of the above categories or if dont know where it should go.

## Meta:

Discussion of the organization of this page. 

EXAMPLES: Should we look at using twist? persistent ways of exchange are too hard to publish. instanteous and interactive avenues like chat has the problem of persistence and consistency, and most importantly, is not inclusive enough. many participants lack consistent internet or do not have reliable access to the proper technology for running a slack/gitter client. email is persistent, dynamic, inclusive, and easy to publish. The disadvantage is that it's disorganized. This kind of stuff goes here.
