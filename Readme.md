# postMarketOS 
----------------------------
This is a collection of writings about the postmarketOS. We focus on the philosophy of design, branding, publicity, and marketing, as well as UX and systems research. Most of the work here is focused on perception and relationships, rather than the nuts and bolts. 

**NOTICE** 
*We are working on a promotoinal video,* 
Oriented by some preliminary work on the branding and anthropology of a few of postmarketOS's hypothetical user demographics.

*We are looking for participants on this project who possess or would like to possess aplicable skills in either the preliminary theoretical and design wwork, the plannning and execution (production), post-production (editing and after-effects) as well as the promo's insertion strategy, or internal usage with focus groups and market radaring.*
Thanks!

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in this discussion. Feel free to ask questions if something is too vague or too poetic. I am more than happy, I would be exstatix to recieve your questions, comments, criticisms, and collaborations. I urge you to participate even if you think it is not your field. 

The target audience for this is our ENGINEERS, **YOU**. We need your contributions, mutual comprehension is the goal here.

# Theoretical
## UX: 

The anthropology of our users and their tool systems. 

WHAT: *UX is more than just designing interfaces.* It is a study of the app from the user's point of view. It is an observational exercise. UX Design must take behavioral observations and transform them into actionable conclusions that can determine design decisions.

key words: abstraction layer, gestalt, user-story, user path, information flows

## Branding: 

the psychology of identity, community, and use

WHAT: *Branding is more than just your logo and jingle.* It is a study into the perception of your organizations activities, measuring sentiment and comparing that with other brands in the same space. Branding effort is about finding a way to tell your product's story, a way to tell your user's story and how your product is an essential element of that story. Branding is **essential**
to the success and survival of any endeavor.

Key words: positioning, theme, visual identity, relationship, narrative, mythos

## Philosophy/Poetry

general considerations about the nature of reality which are pertinent to our activitiea at postmarketOS

WHAT: *Philosphy and poetry are more than mere decorative elememts.* They help guide and orient all other efforts. They contextualize approaches and establish base assumptions of logic that can brinf sophistication to our efforts and help us innovate.

-----------
# Practical
## Marketing:

understanding who your users are and their lives. learning about them and how to relate to them.

WHAT: *marketing is more than just commercials and selling.* marketing is not equal to commercialization. It is the eyes and ears of the operations. what is working? what isn't working? who are our usera? what do they want from our product? what are their dteams hopes and inspirations? how can our product, besides solving their pain-point, align with the other aspects of their life?

key words: product-market fit, marketing plan, top-down and bottom-up market evaluation, appeals, maslov

## Aesthetic Design: 

both the image and the story. the metaphors and sense associations and conceptual associations. their applications as well.

WHAT: *Aesthetic Design is more than just making it look pleasing and legible.* The visual identity of the brand it's products gives a sense of coherent personhood to the product. Almost all brands(excepting most linux distros) have spent a lot of time and effort on creating allegorical references to their user-product-brand relaionship chain.

key words: textures, mythos, allegory, reference, moodboard

## Publicity:

how do people learn about your products and brand?

Aesthetic Design, your brand's mythos, your consumer's pain points, and your solution can be systematically expressed using the guides of Marketing (first lesson: how does market research guide design?)

## User-Interface Projects: 

New pmOS-sourced functionality and engineering perspectives

WHAT:here we put concrete ideas for the UI and how the experience of the user can unfold through direct interactions with the product.

things @AndrewMcSwain is considering: hacking the android interfaces to improve flexibility and/or ease users into a creative and technical mentality. making it easier to hack them (as easy as html css or react). clone android interface as a starting point for a possible pmOS skin or theme. multiple themes or profiles that can be shifted between, without losing work or modifying stack, just shift abstraction layer characteristics to better suit need. this will require it's own page. this kind of stuff goes here.


### Scraps and Notes:

where everything can go, if you dont want it any of the above categories or if dont know where it should go.

### Meta:

Discussion of the organization of this page. 

Examples: Should we look at using twist? persistent ways of exchange are too hard to publish into. instanteous and interactive avenues like chat has the problem of persistence and consistency, and most importantly, is not inclusive enough. many participants lack consistent internet or do not have reliable access to the proper technology for running a slack/gitter client. email is persistent dynamic inclusive and easy to publish and inclusive but disorganized. This kind of stuff goes here.
