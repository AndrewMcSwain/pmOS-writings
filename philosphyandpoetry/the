the importance of forgetting was discussed on HN these days(link), and someome reminded us all, thanks, ironicially, to the written word, that Socrates complained that widespread literacy has: ...[insert quote here]...degrading man's sense of remembering. 

It has been shown that the presence of handheld devices with internet search are super helpful for remembering dates or numbers, but that also means that we are less likely to remember those kinds of things because google is doing it for us (link). What might be at play here is a small-group instinct to specialize focus and abilities. "I won't remember because that's usually what X does" 
other pov (and an argument against surveilance)
