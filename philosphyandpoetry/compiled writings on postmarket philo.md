humans are toolmakers. one thing we are especially good at is making tools that make tools. most mainstream options don't give the common user enough credit, considering that our species has been making incredible tech by hand for at least 200 thousand years.

a lot of us gringos/westerners have become mentally/technologically lethargic due to post industrialization. not necessarily the case in the rest of the world. making an accessible device would be huge--@andrewmcswain@#postmarketOS chat - 7/26


I'd like postmarketOS to be not just hackable, but something stable, realible and easy to install and use, a mobile OS I could finally recommend my friends to change the stock android with. The android hacking community is sometimes like: This ROM is only for l33tz, don't install, if you don't know what are you doing. I'm not sure, how many of the devs agree, but it would be cool, if I could recommend installing pmOS, after the device was labeled stable, and users would see a friendly, patient community and detailed documentation to install and use it. @ata2001 said 11:30am June252017
