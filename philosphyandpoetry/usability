High ladders in telecom affect cost
but they also ease access to hackability

The unrefined nature and less proportional sophostication is integral to it's hackability.

How to create ease of ENTRY and INTEGRATION, rather than 'ease of use' which constrains users and isolates groups of users. lumping users into levels of binary ability (l33x vs n3wbz). This is very
 damaging to the community, and is the current state of things.
