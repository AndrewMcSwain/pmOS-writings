So, linux has been on android for a while now. For quite some time we have had this capacity. Despite it's continued limitations, as well as our own limitations as users, owners, operators, what have we to say about creative engineering?

For me, one of the beautiful things about linux is how i can be the creator of my own environments. I can tweak and shape according to my personal tastes and necessities. 

The more I learn about linux, the more i can do, but also, and this is one thing that many people may not have considered is, how my desire or necessity to modify my environment according to preknowledge gives me further capability, through the act, and will be a force that motivates me to further my training(or general use/interaction). Though this hinges on one's capacity to relate to the ways in which the "pioneers" have related that foreknowledge.Â 


In other words, documentation.


One immediate example: some people want to play a game or watch a video. Some people want to feel like they are a part of something socially, but their social circles do not exist in the same communities as that foreknowledge. Sometimes these two communities don't share enough culture to communicate the existence of that foreknowledge or it's importance. This is the curse of a hyperspecialized and calcified society. The modules are too far removed from each other in their communication to understand each other intellectually to be able to react to changes in the environment, collectively. They have been so far removed for so long that they share different constructs of*for* reality.




Imagine a word processor. Imagine if it had two layers, or interfaces, one to process the text, to write it, then another one to format it (spacing, styles, fonts). Some people would enjoy that, and find it useful or convenient, others may hate it because maybe they dont think sequentially, so they prefer a unified interface to do both at the same time. What I've just described is A) web pages and B) word processing on a personal computer.

Some issues may arise on both sides.. on paper (it's a table)

How do you get social feedback and emotional reinforcement from your own community if your community has not even been made aware of the existence of that phenomenon with which the 'foreknowledge' is representing?

Perhaps this is Branding

Not everyone wears Nike clothing, but those that don't wear Nike know what it is, and can identify with it. They have made complex conscious and subconscious associations with the brand -- even if they have never worn Nike or been in a store in their lives. Nonetheless, they know about it and (the marketers hope) have a crisp vision of what Nike is, most importantly though is they have a crisp and holographic view, with conscious and subconscious associations and sentiments, about WHO wears Nike and why. This plays a big role in the behavior of the market share vector of a company--- future users, more less, the same? How can you know?

Maybe that last part (predicting topology flucuations in the market-share vectors of global public companies) isn't all that perinent to our immediate considerations. What is pertinent, though, is what you are, what your users think you are, what non-users*** think you are, and, most interestingly, what users think non-users think about them (the socially reinforced internal view of the public-facing self (your reflection)

So, I ask, may I stop constantly reflecting to you already, justifying myself, and get to work on this project, or would you rather have me go away?


In other matters: recently there was a call from largetech for humanities and liberal arts people. I'm glad that the the exacts are finally coming around to the benefits of poetry. That doesn't mean I find it worth my time to serve them (indeed I do not), but I am offering my insights to you, and to this project, because I have the hope that they will be ported to a worthy endeavor. Indeed, that is precisely *why* I am here, to guarantee that they will. Better: that the endeavor follows the winds of the salt driven tears of the lost sailor's wife, pregnant with his son, praying to the moon that the tide brings him home.

My duty is user-focused and OS-oriented-design and systems-architectures and systems-designs. Ways the user flows through the system. His lightcone and his story. 

 Human-centric design.

I am a hacker, an anarchist, a nature-loving weirdo. I just happen to be better at thinking in systems views than in proceedural ones.



---Footnotes:
*Foreknowledge and preknowledgd imply movement, but not a positivist's view of "the march of time"
**in portuguese it is "for" reality, as s a model to be applied to reality. in english it is "of" reality, or "...being an essential quality of..." something.
***user/non-user is usually not binary. We need to think about degrees of use. we must also think about the flucuations of the degrees of use.
