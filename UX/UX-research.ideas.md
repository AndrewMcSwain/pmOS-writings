Here we present and elaborate the spec for new UX oriented research. 

These are in sequence: 

1. List 'User Profiles' as characterization of a certain group of users, generalized.

2. User Paths: What are the paths of use of these users? Of course, we must look at their workflows, but we must, and more importantly, examine what may be called "man's paths of discovery and deepening intimacy with tech"

3. Considering the above examinations, start to think about what sorts of abstractions layers and 'doorways to deepening and discovery' so that users can feel a sense of awe and improved utility according to his/her evolving necessities. I don't suggest that we adapt interfaces dynamically/programmatically or with AI, that would be unecessary and absurd. I mean that, if the user digs around, he`ll find our doorway to help him get close to the metal and design his own interface or even new functionality.
