o perhaps it is best not to think of development as a progression "up,"but a progression backwards. Us finding our roots, remembering the worldview of the human that has been walking the earth and building tools and living in families and tribes (communities) for at least a million years.

-One more important point to consider, in this mythos, that is not necessarily a progression backwards, to finding our roots, is the discovery of electricity by the occident. This technology is proportionally very very very new.

-One more important point to consider, in this mythos, that is not necessarily a progression backwards, to finding our roots, is the discovery of electricity by the occident. This technology is proportionally very very very new. When understanding our journey, we not only must know where we've been, but also where we are and where we are going. So the discovery of fire is more or less equal to the discovery of electricity.                                                  +One more important point to consider, in this mythos, that is not necessarily a progression backwards, to finding our roots, is the discovery of electricity by the occident. Within the grand scope of the human and proto-human journey, this technology is new. When understanding our journey, we not only must know where we've been, but also where we are and where we are going. So the discovery of fire is more or less equal to the discovery of electricity, in some archetypal
 sense. Similarly, our discovery and utilization of electromagnetism and their constant flows through spacetime, which
is a merger, or vollapsing, a unidication, of scientific paradigms that occurred even more recently. We continue to ,ake breath-taking discoveries about the behavior, the "suchness" of phenomenon most fundamental to existence. The torch continues to light new and vast areas of collectively awareness of the suchness of this existence, and it isn't necessar
ily emanating from our tower of babel.

+Some of those changes we could be reaping onky nowm with respect to understanding other life forms and the complexity of ecological relations, are already on the brink of being lost forever. we hold pseudo-absolute power in our hands, literally, now we must learn to be disciplined and use it **wisely**.
+
+
+The scale of the impact of these important discovery is totally incaluable from our current perspective. Some of those
 impacts, withput propee usage, will surely destroy us. How do we operate? From where will we find the wisdom to operate wisely? I know it seems redundant, but it isn't.

; or tribe, herd, hive, super-hive.
