as is explained in the <<Readme.md> branding is more than just a logo. It is a user's relationship with the product, service, or organization. 

to understand and thereby cultivate this relationship a collection of anthropology, psychology, and art is used.

## Branding:

Objective: find associations between common values and/or appealing values that align the user-product-brand chain.

In this example we'll be drawing fr

  /---Product
 /      |
/      \|/
A >-(commonality)<- B
       /|\         /
        |         /
       User------/

User is A. B is integrally like A. Brand's product is also A and provides B.

(note the word find and not create is used. in order to generate a holographic personhood for a brand, one must maintain brand coherence, which is accomplished by remaining *authentic* --ya dig?)

Example: Family Love and tool making are ancient, primordial, integral to humanity. 

"You should use this tech, learn it, become more human (revive your deep human roots)(which have been somewhat l/ost in post-industrial world)"

## brand associations
### primary association
love your family
be a toolmaker

### lateral association
Exercise is important- dont be sedentary
complex and amazing tool making an tool use is important for everyone too. --- dont be mentally sedentary. 

## Conclusion
The primary associations are deeply personal, transcending the ego and focusing on primordial aspects vertabrae life. Family love and love of tech are both part of our ancestral memory.

Constrast this with the lateral association provided. In this case, it is appealing to the ego, personally, and, depending on the person, perhaps more powerfully appealing to the ego's need for social recognition. I 
am mentally fit. I can use linux on my phone like a boss, what say ye'?

Both types of associations are used *all the time*. Every single ad that runs on TV or in magazines has armies of people thinking this over.

Objective: How might publicity and branding associate these, emphasizing this commonality in clever ways.
