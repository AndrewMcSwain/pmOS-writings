So perhaps it is best not to think of development as a progression "up,"but a progression backwards. Us finding our roots, remembering the worldview of the human that has been walking the earth and building tools and living in families and tribes (communities) for at least a million years.

-One more important point to consider, in this mythos, that is not necessarily a progression backwards, to finding our roots, is the discovery of electricity by the occident. In the grand scope of time this technology is very new. We have possessed knowledge and practice on the manipulation of fire for (insert time) years. We have had electrity for maybe 200 or so, and radio hardly a century.

The discovery of fire is more or less equal to the discovery of electricity in some archetypal
 sense. Similarly, our discovery and utilization of electromagnetism and their constant flows through spacetime, which
is a merger, or collapsing, a unification, of scientific paradigms that occurred even more recently. We continue to make breath-taking discoveries about the behavior, the "suchness" of phenomenon most fundamental to existence. The torch continues to light new and vast areas of collectively awareness of the suchness of this existence, and it isn't necessarily emanating from our tower of babel.

+Some of those changes we could be reaping onky nowm with respect to understanding other life forms and the complexity of ecological relations, are already on the brink of being lost forever. we hold pseudo-absolute power in our hands, literally, now we must learn to be disciplined and use it **wisely**.

talk more here about using wisely

+
+The scale of the impact of these important discovery is totally incaluable from our current perspective. Some of those
 impacts, withput propee usage, will surely destroy us. How do we operate? From where will we find the wisdom to operate wisely? I know it seems redundant, but it isn't.

+Consider this:

+the different paradigms of social thought, with respect to scale (self, famiky, tribe, community, state, nation, union
; or tribe, herd, hive, super-hive.
