What happens when someone else, a non-user, sees that said person, who in this case may have begun relatively recently to use linux, is able to do things that the non-user sees as useful, but is outside of his capacity? You`ve just sparked interest in use, or at least a sense of respect and awe, in the non-user. This phenomenon, this exchange, creates two things: 
--an opportunity for mentorship
--a curiosity or motivation for the non-user to involve himself
--a wider acceptance of the hacker

you don't have to sit in front of a computer all day and watch anime to be a hacker. That is a specific user group, but not all of us are do that. If you are one of them, that's fine and great, but a lot of people do not involve themselves further with computing because of this stereotype. The above phenomenon can help improve general user-sophistication. Which is good for almost everyone, save maybe the NSA and blackhats that don't like a challenge.

the people being targeted or who we would would like to attract (or are disposed to being attracted), have, within the group, a diversity of subtle differences in identity and necessity that can be expressed in two ways: functionality and design. 

Visual and brand design is the narrative that connects the tool with the user, with it's use, and the community of collective meaning that user and his tool use is embedded in.
