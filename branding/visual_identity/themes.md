abraxis/abrasax
Interesting esoteric -- fits with hacking anf linux -- appeal to curiosity -- edgy
Tagline perhaps a bit too dramatic
abraxis may be too 'woo woo'religous for mass appeal/further adoption, 

perhaps this identity would be good for endomarketimg (for internal devs)
also risks being very cliche / not future proof

paleolithic man in modern times


Note on theme 5
If a brutalist theme or "aged-brutalism" / dilapidated theming is assumed then we can have more conventional aesthetic for front-facing (how do our non-targets view our market and how do our users know others (mostly non-users) are seeing users as a result of our user's association with the brand) and introductory media (includes potential future users. This can be layered on top of other layers of 'close to the metal' representations and organizations of content and functionality (design approaches).

Note on what brand is NOT
What it isn't: ubuntu is bright and trendy --like big name companies-- i suggest we counter this-- signals we are different
